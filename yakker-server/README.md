## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This will automatically open the app in a browser on port 3001.<br>

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
Testing assertions:
* that the state changed when typed
* that the state rendered to the page

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
